# MAVILLE Application

Requires Java 21 and Maven.

## Install & Run

These are the instructions to compile and run the app in command line.
You can also use whatever is available from your favorite IDE.

1. Clone the repository using git (see Code button above), move to the created folder
2. Build an executable: `mvn package`
3. Run: `java -jar target/maVille-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

You can also run tests: `mvn test`

## Project structure

- `README.md`  -> This file ;)
- `pom.xml`    -> Maven project information
- `.gitignore` -> Specifies which files are ignored by git 
- `src/main`   -> Code for the app
- `src/test`   -> Code for the tests
- `rapport/`   -> The engineering report you have to write for this course (in HTML)
- `visual_paradigm/` -> A place to put your Visual Paradigm project (also try to work one at a time on vpp files and push often to avoid merge conflicts)
